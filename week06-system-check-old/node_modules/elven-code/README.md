These are files that Charlie commonly uses or that he commonly shares with his students.

To run the tests:

    node jasmine-runner.js
    
    
The config file might look like this:
    
```json
{
    "calvert": {
        "base-dir": "/home/charlie/",
        "site-dirs": [
          "Documents/AllTest",
          "Git/CloudNotes/Assignments",
          "Git/CloudNotes/Prog270",
          "Git/CloudNotes/Isit322"
        ]
    }
}
```
